	DingooSMS v1.3 for Native OS by lion_rsm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



What is this?
~~~~~~~~
DingooSMS is an emulator for 8-bit Sega Master System and Game Gear (hereinafter SMS and GG respectively) gaming consoles for the portable gaming console Dingoo A320 (SIM-version for Native OS). DingooSMS is part of the "Dingoo Emulation Pack by lion_rsm" emulator package.

What makes this emulator better than others?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
At the moment, there are several SMS/GG emulators for Dingoo Native OS, which perform their tasks quite successfully. The DingooSMS emulator has several advantages over its counterparts:
   - Unified user interface with convenient and intuitive control;
   - High emulation speed, good game compatibility;
   - Fast forward emulation function (Fast forward);
   - Loading of compressed ROM game files, as well as an automatic ROM file compression function;
   - Full-screen hardware scaling using IPU;
   - Ability to select a country/region before starting the game;
   - Support for games in NTSC and PAL television standards;
   - Support for FM-synthesized sound in games that support this mode;
   - Support for 3D games (red-blue anaglyph glasses required);
   - Support for game cartridge covers.



Emulator Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Unzip the archive on your computer to any folder. Inside the folder, you'll find several files, among them:

	DingooSMS.sim	- the emulator itself;
	README		- this guide;

Copy the DingooSMS.sim file to the GAME folder of your Dingoo A320 gaming console, removing any old SMS/GG emulator from there beforehand. If there's a DingooSMS.cfg configuration file from a previous version of the emulator in the GAME folder, it should also be deleted.

Add Sega Master System games in .sms format or Sega Game Gear games in .gg format to your Dingoo if they are not already present. It is recommended to keep SMS and GG games in separate folders to avoid name conflicts when saving game states and setting files.



Using the Emulator
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Select "Interesting game" from the "Game center" menu on your Dingoo. In the file browser, find your folder with SMS or GG games, select the game you're interested in, and press the "A" button. The DingooSMS emulator will launch, load, and run the game you selected. To enter the emulator menu, press "Start" and "Select" simultaneously or the "Power" button.



Support for Compressed ROM Files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
DingooSMS supports loading ROM files compressed using the ZIP algorithm. To create a compressed ROM file, pack the respective .sms or .gg file using a suitable archiver into .zip. Rename the obtained .zip back to .sms or .gg and transfer it to Dingoo. When opening the game file, the emulator will automatically recognize the compression and decompress it.

The emulator is also capable of compressing ROM files independently. If this function is active and the loaded game wasn't compressed previously, the emulator will offer to compress the ROM file of this game upon exit. Utilize the compression feature for SMS/GG ROM files to save memory on Dingoo!



Support for Cartridge Cover Files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
DingooSMS can load cartridge cover files. The cover is displayed in all emulator menus except the main menu. The cover file is a 24-bit PNG image with dimensions of 136-146 x 200 px for portrait orientation and 200 x 136-146 px for landscape orientation. The cover image file should have the same name as the game file it's created for. Examples of covers for some games can be found in the emulator delivery package.



# Emulator Main Menu
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
**Resume**
- Exit the menu and return to the game. You can also return to the game by pressing the "B" key.

**Save state**
- Save the current game state to a file. The state file is saved in the same folder as the game. The filename consists of the game's name and an extension from .sv0 to .sv9. Use the "Left" and "Right" keys to select a logical slot to save the state, and press "A" to save. There are a total of 10 slots available. A screenshot of the game state saved in the selected slot is displayed on the right.

**Load state**
- Load the game state from a file. The file should be in the same folder as the game, and its name should match the game's name with an extension from .sv0 to .sv9. Use the "Left" and "Right" keys to select a slot with the desired game state, and press "A" to load it. After loading the game state, the emulator will automatically return to the game. While on the "Load state" or "Save state" option, you can press the "X" key to delete the game state from the selected slot. Confirm your intentions to delete the corresponding game state file.

**Skip frames**
- This option specifies how many emulated frames will be skipped before rendering on the screen. It can increase emulation speed at the expense of image smoothness. A value of "0" means that all emulated frames are displayed on the screen. "AUTO" means that the emulator automatically decides which frames to skip to achieve 100% game emulation speed. Use the "Left" and "Right" keys to select the desired value, and press "A" to choose "AUTO." If the emulator's performance is insufficient, it's recommended to set this option to "AUTO."

**Full screen**
- This option allows you to configure the image output to be stretched across the Dingoo screen or displayed in its native resolution with black borders. If emulation speed is inadequate, it's recommended to set this option to "OFF" as rendering in native resolution requires less processing and is faster.

**Sound volume**
- This option allows you to set the sound volume or disable sound entirely. Use the "Left" and "Right" keys to select the desired value, and press "A" to choose "OFF." If emulation speed is insufficient, try setting this option to "OFF."

**Advanced sets**
- Menu with additional options.

**Reset**
- Reset the game to its initial state. You need to confirm your actions in the subsequent dialog screen.

**Exit**
- Exit DingooSMS and return to the Dingoo menu.

# Emulator Additional Menu
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
**Video settings -> Fullscreen scaling**
- This option allows you to set the image scaling algorithm when outputting to the screen. "HARDWARE" indicates the use of the hardware IPU block, which performs bilinear image scaling. This option is relevant if "Full screen" is set to "ON."

**Input settings**
- This menu allows you to map physical Dingoo keys to SMS or GG virtual gamepad keys. You can redefine only some of the keys where it makes sense.

**Input settings -> Diagonals helper**
- The Dingoo directional pad design is not ideal for pressing diagonals, and it's challenging with accuracy issues. This option activates a function designed to improve the response of diagonal key combinations.

**CPU speed, MHz**
- This option allows you to set the Dingoo's CPU frequency during SMS/GG game emulation. The normal CPU frequency is 336 MHz. When entering the emulator menu, it automatically lowers the frequency to 336 MHz. Higher values increase emulation speed but drain your Dingoo's battery faster. Use the "Left" and "Right" keys to select a value from the predefined list, and press "A" to increase the option's value by one. However, some frequencies have no effect on CPU performance, so it's recommended to use frequencies from the predefined list. Values above 400 MHz are at your own risk, and the emulator's author is not responsible for any consequences of changing the CPU frequency!

**Show FPS mode**
- FPS (Frames Per Second) is the number of frames the emulator can render or emulate (depending on the counting mode) in one second. When "OFF" is selected, the FPS counter is disabled. When "RENDERED" is selected, it displays the number of rendered frames, and "EMULATED" shows the number of emulated virtual frames. This value helps assess the overall emulation speed. Higher values are better. The nominal FPS for NTSC games is ~60, and for PAL ~50 in "EMULATED" counting mode. If you don't understand the purpose of this option, it's best to keep it turned off.

**Save global settings**
- Save emulator settings to the "DingooSMS.cfg" file in the emulator's folder (usually the "GAME" folder). If the "DingooSMS.cfg" file is present, it will be loaded and applied when the emulator starts.

**Save game settings**
- Save emulator settings to a file named after the currently loaded game with a .cfg extension in the game's folder. This configuration file takes precedence over "DingooSMS.cfg" for the loaded game, allowing specific emulator settings for each game.

**About emulator**
- Brief information about the emulator, its author, and hotkeys for control.



# Additional Special Settings Menu at Emulator Startup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Some rarely changed settings and settings that should be applied before loading a game ROM are placed in the additional special settings menu of the emulator. You can access this menu by holding the "Select" key while starting the emulator. To save the changed settings, you need to enter the emulator's main menu, go to "Advanced sets," and activate "Save global settings" or "Save game settings."

**Country/Region**
- This option allows you to set the hardware configuration of the console based on the selected country/region. The loaded game may behave differently on different hardware configurations, such as having different resolutions/frame rates, different timing for hardware components, specific text/title screen localization, hardware region binding, and more. Option values and hardware configuration differences:
   - AUTO - Automatic region selection based on some characteristics of the ROM file.
   - US - American region - video standard - NTSC.
   - EU - European region - video standard - PAL.
   - JP - Asian region - video standard - NTSC.

**Auto compress ROM**
- This option enables automatic compression of the ROM file of the currently loaded game when exiting the emulator. If you don't want to compress ROM files for your SMS/GG games, set this option to "OFF."

**Old school mode**
- If you feel like a seasoned veteran of the old school gaming, you can set this option to "ON" :)

**Default settings**
- Reset the emulator settings to their default values. You can later save the reset settings using "Save global settings" or "Save game settings" from the "Advanced sets" menu.

**Continue**
- Exit this additional menu, load the game's ROM file, and transition DingooSMS into emulation mode.

# Hotkey Combinations in the Game
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
At any point during the game, you can enter the emulator's main menu by pressing the key combination "Start"+"Select" or "Power." You can also quickly save the current game state in RAM by pressing the key combination "R"+"Select." To load a state from RAM, press "L"+"Start." The key combinations "L"+"R"+"Up" and "L"+"R"+"Down" allow you to increase or decrease the sound volume. Holding the key combination "L"+"R"+"Right" puts the emulator in "Fast forward" mode, allowing you to fast-forward gameplay.

# Emulator Operation When Connected to a TV
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When the emulator runs on a Dingoo connected to a TV, the options "Full screen" and "CPU speed, MHz" are locked. The "Full screen" option is set to "ON," and "CPU speed, MHz" is set to "336." The latter value is due to the fact that Dingoo's video output to the TV only works correctly at a CPU frequency of 336 MHz.
